<h1>Hello, I am Abhijit Nagaraj</h1>
<p>
  A curious learner, turning lines of code into purposeful creation.

Welcome to my corner of the web! I’m a passionate learner with an ever-growing love for web development. My journey began with a spark—an eagerness to understand how the digital world is built—and that spark quickly grew into a flame of fascination for everything from sleek front-end designs to the elegant logic behind clean, functional code.

<p>Though I’m still early in this path, I approach each new concept with wide-eyed wonder and a steady determination to grow. I believe that learning is not just a phase, but a mindset—one that has guided me through diverse experiences and now fuels my pursuit of creating beautiful, user-friendly web experiences.</p>

Here, you’ll find projects that reflect not just what I’ve learned, but how I think, build, and dream. I’m excited to keep evolving, one keystroke at a time—and I’m glad you’re here to witness the journey.
